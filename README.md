**Forecasting and Trading CME Soybean Futures with ML Ensembles**

In this project we will endeavour to exploit any such inefficiencies in the price and build an ensemble of supervised learning machine models to forecast price returns of CME soybean futures. In contrast to absolute price levels, returns are well-known to be stationary and therefore lend themselves better to modeling.

Our model aims to forecast whether the closing price tomorrow will be higher than today. Naturally, we could extend this methodology and build another model to forecast whether tomorrow's price will be lower than today. However, for brevity, this project will focus on the former. The code, however, is easily extendable to the latter scenario.

Once our model has been built and tuned, we then develop a simple trading strategy. If we predict tomorrow's price to close higher, we enter a long position for a holding period of just one day. Finally, we evaluate the performance of this strategy versus an outright buy-and-hold strategy.

Note that our model can equally be applied in forecasting returns for other commodities futures contracts, stocks, currency pairs, etc.
